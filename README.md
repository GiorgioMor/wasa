# Fantastic coffee (decaffeinated)

This repository contains the basic structure for [Web and Software Application](http://gamificationlab.uniroma1.it/en/wasa/) homework project.
It has been described in class.

"Fantastic coffee (decaffeinated)" is a simplified version for the WASA course, not suitable for a production environment.
The full version can be found in the "Fantastic Coffee" repository.

## Project structure

* `cmd/` contains all executables; Go programs here should only do "executable-stuff", like reading options from the CLI/env, etc.
	* `cmd/healthcheck` is an example of a daemon for checking the health of servers daemons; useful when the hypervisor is not providing HTTP readiness/liveness probes (e.g., Docker engine)
	* `cmd/webapi` contains an example of a web API server daemon
* `demo/` contains a demo config file
* `doc/` contains the documentation (usually, for APIs, this means an OpenAPI file)
* `service/` has all packages for implementing project-specific functionalities
	* `service/api` contains an example of an API server
	* `service/globaltime` contains a wrapper package for `time.Time` (useful in unit testing)
* `vendor/` is managed by Go, and contains a copy of all dependencies
* `webui/` is an example of a web frontend in Vue.js; it includes:
	* Bootstrap JavaScript framework
	* a customized version of "Bootstrap dashboard" template
	* feather icons as SVG
	* Go code for release embedding

Other project files include:
* `open-npm.sh` starts a new (temporary) container using `node:lts` image for safe web frontend development (you don't want to use `npm` in your system, do you?)

## Go vendoring

This project uses [Go Vendoring](https://go.dev/ref/mod#vendoring). You must use `go mod vendor` after changing some dependency (`go get` or `go mod tidy`) and add all files under `vendor/` directory in your commit.

For more information about vendoring:

* https://go.dev/ref/mod#vendoring
* https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2020/04/modules-06-vendoring.html

## Node/NPM vendoring

This repository contains the `webui/node_modules` directory with all dependencies for Vue.JS. You should commit the content of that directory and both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

## Docker

You can build and run the project with Docker

* Backend
```shell
docker build -t homework-backend:latest -f Dockerfile.backend .
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 --rm homework-backend:latest
```

* Frontend
